<h1>Contributing Guidlines</h1>
<br>
Create a folder with the project name and add all files for project in that folder. Add name of the contributor in the contributor.txt of the project submitted folder.
<br>
<h3>Sample Folder Structure:</h3>

|--contributor_name_folder<br> 
|_____main_app_folder (add app files in this sub folder)<br>
|_____Contributor.txt (contains name of the contributor in this file inside the contributors name folder)

We will add the contributors details in the repository's Contributors.md file as well as display them on the fame board too (major contributions only).
